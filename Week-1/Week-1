## **High Level Components of a browser.**
The browser main components are:
### **User Interface**: 
This include address bar,forward,backward button,bookmarking menu, etc. Every part of the browser display except the window where you see the requested page.
### **Browser Engine** :
It helps in managing action between UI and rendering engine.
### **Rendering Engine**:
This engine is responsible for displaying the content on the screen.For example , if the requested content is HTML,the rendering engine parses the HTML and CSS ,and display the parsed content on screen.
### **Networking**:
For network calls such as HTTP requests, using different implementations for different platform behind a platform-independent interface.
### **UI BACKEND**:

## **Rendering engine and its use**
Rendering Engine As the name suggests, this component is responsible for rendering a specific web page requested by the user on their screen. It interprets HTML and XML documents along with images that are styled or formatted using CSS, and a final layout is generated, which is displayed on the user interface.

## **Parsers (HTML, CSS, etc)**
With the help of parser the HTML code and CSS parses to form DOM tree and stylesheet.

## **Script Processing ,Tree constructio, Order of script processing, Layout and Painting**

Layout is a recursive process. It begins at the root renderer, and correspond to html elemet of the HTML document, and this process keeps working recursively to check how much space each element will take on the page. Output of the layout process is the box model.

Paint

This is the last process before the page is ready for end user. It involves drawing out text color, images, border every visual part of element. It is done onto multiple surface called layers.
